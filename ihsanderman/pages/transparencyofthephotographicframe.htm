      <p>Photography, as opposed to traditional images, is a form of image production that depends on 'selection' rather than synthesis. The photographer forms the image by selecting out of what already exists &quot;out there&quot;. A fundamental classification of this sort is developed by the frame of the photograph. In other words, it comes out in relation to the arrangement of the image while taking the photograph. The meaning of the image is directly determined by what is included within the photographic frame. This meaning is shifted as the elements within the frame change. Automatically, a relationship among these elements is built, and this develops, mostly, independent of the contextual relations among these elements in reality. If the photographer selects only two of the people out of a crowd to include within the frame, a new relationship is formed among the two which is valid for the new context of the elements, but does not exist in reality. John Hilliard's well known series, Cause of Death, is a proper example for the interaction of framing in a photograph and meaning of the image.</p>
    <p>The meanings that can be found in reality are the products of a multi-dimensional relationships. These constructs, which are thought to be hidden in the appearances of objects and phenomena, come out of very different levels of relations than their appearances offer. The temporal/historical context in which these appearances develop is the prime determinant of the meaning. The structures of meaning in reality can be considered as subjected to cultural-ideological codification.</p>
    <p>As its subject, the photographic image acquires only a portion of reality, and this is realized through the framing of the image while taking the photograph. The reality is always larger than the photographic image; it is a unity in itself that is consistent in terms of meaning. The photographic image does not belong to this structure of reality, and the unity out there does not offer itself ready to be framed in a photograph. Most of the time, the photographer faces a number of choices to decide on the frame of the photograph. The importance of the photographic frame that sets the visual boundaries of the image, is emphasized when a photograph is re-photographed. In this case, and if there is no clue to prove contrary, the ambiguity always persists as to whether the subject of the photograph is another two dimensional photograph or it is an appearance from real world. On the other hand, a question of this kind is mostly unimportant in consideration of what the photograph shows; thus, the photograph of a photograph comes on the same level with the reality that it signifies.</p>
    <p>The reality also enjoys a meaningful continuity, outside its portion which is the subject of the photograph. This continuity is not only a function of continuous passing of time, but it is also a matter of continuity in terms of space and meaning. The photographer chooses a small section of this continuity as the subject of the image. In this sense, every photographic image has certain physical boundaries. The boundaries of the photographic image frame is significant because of the fact that it separates the elements to acquire meaning, from those of the ordinary reality. The 'piece' that is obtained through this gesture of photographing, which can also be meaning, from those of the ordinary reality. The 'piece' that is obtained through this gesture of photographing, which can also be called &quot;a complex act of cutting&quot; (Hollis Frampton) , is transformed into a different structure because of the spatio-temporal discontinuity.</p>
    <p>Within the whole technical process, the most important decision that the photographer makes comes out at this stage. At the same time, this decision is the most materialized form of struggle that the photographer as operator is involved in, together and against the photographic apparatus.</p>
    <p>The decision on photographic framing is in existence until the end of the technical process. In further stages of this process, even though it is possible to search for different arrangements for the image to alter relations and meanings, one is always bound within the image space given in the first decision of framing.</p>
    <p>In these respects, the frame of the photographic image shows significant structural differences when compared with those of traditional images and of technical images, like cinema, video, etc..</p>
    <p>In traditional images, only the 'inside' of the frame gains importance; the image itself is conceived in and for the boundaries of the frame. These types of images do not refer to their extensions beyond the picture frame. Moreover, one cannot think of the image to overflow outside the frame. If anything outside the frame is referred to, it is established by what is shown within the picture frame. In other words, the things outside the frame are a part of the scheme that is created within the frame, and they form a consistent unity in terms of meaning. One may even further claim that the elements in and outside the frame continue their existence on the same level. Even when things are not shown, nothing is left out of the picture frame. In this sense, the traditional images can be said to preserve their unity within themselves, by avoiding the chances to question certain created within the frame, and they form a consistent unity in terms of meaning. One may even further claim that the elements in and outside the frame continue their existence on the same level. Even when things are not shown, nothing is left out of the picture frame. In this sense, the traditional images can be said to preserve their unity within themselves, by avoiding the chances to question certain possibilities left outside the frame. And the elements of the image cannot be considered to exist outside these contextual parameters; they are created for and within the boundaries of the frame. A relation to go beyond these boundaries is out of question.</p>
    <p>When considering the image frame in technical images, the situation is somewhat different. Because of the mode of production and, thus, in close affinity with reality, the technical images offer a special case. In both traditional and technical images, it is apt to say that the image frame is conceived in accordance with a certain intention. Technical images are produced through &quot;selection&quot; by the apparatus, especially when photography is concerned. The research into the positioning of these images in regard to the reality that supplies their source is quite norma&gt; is always chosen from the &quot;larger&quot;. And when these images are viewed, the choices and the intentions behind them are evaluated on the level of consciousness. What is included within the frame brings about the questions of what and why other things are left out. In this regard, cinema is more successful in hiding its real intentions.</p>
    <p>The photographic frame is formed according to certain criteria, by the photographer. But the intentions behind this act cannot be denied. The photographer decides on the frame, according to the positioning (height/distance) of the camera, and the point of view. And this requires a choice among endless possibilities. Within the program of apparatus, this can be seen as the stage in which the will of the operator is most dominant. In the frame, the photographer denied. The photographer decides on the frame, according to the positioning (height/distance) of the camera, and the point of view. And this requires a choice among endless possibilities. Within the program of apparatus, this can be seen as the stage in which the will of the operator is most dominant. In the frame, the photographer includes a portion of reality in which he or she participates. The elements are taken out of their original context and put into a new set of relationships to form totally different meanings. But the photographic image, due to its mode of production and thus, with its close affinity with reality, always brings into fore the things that are not shown, almost on the same plane as what is included within the frame. For an image of a building in a photograph, it is always possible to ask the following: What is behind the building? Where does the road in front of the building lead? Which other buildings are next to it, or, where is this building located? These questions are more related with what is not shown in the photograph, rather than what is inside the photographic frame. Mostly, they are not valid for traditional images. With these characteristics, the photographic images are evaluated as maps of the real world.</p>
    <p>The &quot;frame&quot; in cinema is mobile. The frame moves along with the subject or with the movements of the actors within the same space and the same shot, but always in accordance with the narrative structure and certain intentions. Or the shots that follow one another form different frames. What is left out of the frame in one shot can be included in the next, as to answer our possible questions. No feelings of deprivation or the emergence of questions regarding what is left out of the frame are allowed. And the fact that we should unconditionally view through the given window is smoothly insisted (i.e.suture theory). To sense what is left out of the frame and to ask certain questions in this respect reduce the reliability of the image, and brings out the the role that the intentions play in a given 'choice'. Especially in cinema, this kind of annoyance is not wanted for the believability of the plot. The spectator is expected to agree with the (i.e.suture theory). To sense what is left out of the frame and to ask certain questions in this respect reduce the reliability of the image, and brings out the the role that the intentions play in a given 'choice'. Especially in cinema, this kind of annoyance is not wanted for the believability of the plot. The spectator is expected to agree with the given &quot;viewpoint&quot;, as less critically and more naturally as possible, and to set out his/her experiences accordingly. Mostly, the individual's position within reality requires this kind of inertness as well. Thus, in cinema, the feeling of deprivation is never as intense as in a photographic image. In cinema, the spectator is denied to be aware of the intentions hidden behind the act of framing. The reliability and objectivity is provided by the differentiation of camera movements and positioning in every shot, approving one another. This is also the reason why photographs are regarded as fetish objects In psychoanalytic terms (physically a photograph holds the place of a part that is also left out - castration complex - C.Metz).</p>
    <p>On the other hand, photography is insufficient in terms of the possibilities mentioned above. Because of this, when faced with a photographic image, a part of one's reception procedure is reserved for the questions of what, why and for which purposes is something left out of the photographic frame. Through a critical process of this kind, the already ambiguous meaning aimed within the given photographic frame can further shift towards different directions. The impossibility of a single photograph to form a narrative structure, helps this critical process.</p>
    <p>Moreover, to know what is left out of the frame directly influences the meaning in the photographic frame. The &quot;framing&quot;, among the meaning in the photographic frame. The &quot;framing&quot;, among the whole technical process, can be considered to be the stage over which the operator of the apparatus has the most control. And this makes the photographer the subject of the critical reception mentioned above. In fact, we already know that this apparent &quot;freedom of choice&quot; occurs within the program of apparatus as well. The phenomenon known as &quot;Double Take&quot; within the history of photography (that is, the same photographs of the same subject taken by different people at different times) show us the limits of the photographic program, as much as it is an indication that similar intentions of different people at different times may intersect at the same point on a space-matrix. To summarize, one can say that the photographic frame is formed according to certain intentions, and because of this, for the receptor, what is left out of the picture frame becomes as important as what is in it, and that they are both to be included in the discussions on the interpretations of photographs: within the frame+outside the frame=photographic image. The starting point for this whole argument is the fact that the subject of the photographic image once existed in actual reality, the world &quot;out there&quot;. In accordance with this, an image based critique of the actual context (for what has existed) can be started.</p>
    <p>When we think that photography, at least with its characteristics of &quot;framing&quot;, forms a fictitious structure, and that this is manipulated for various purposes today, we can lay out the reasons why the subjects outside the frame directly concerns the receptor of photographic images. In the light of what is said, the photographic frame can be considered as being gradually transparent and eventually melting away, as a result of criticism that it is subjected to.<br>
