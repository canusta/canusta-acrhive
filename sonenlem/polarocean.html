    <h1>The Polar Ocean</h1>

The Polar Ocean is one of the most inhospitable places on earth.  It freezes into 

an ice cap every winter and thaws every summer.  NASA measures the maximum 

ice extent of the ice cap every year.  This year the maximum ice extent was the 

smallest in recorded history.
