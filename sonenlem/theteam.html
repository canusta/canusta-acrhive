<h1>The Team</h1><br/>
    The team consists of two 42 year olds that come from diverse backgrounds.  The

pair met on an expedition in Iceland two years ago where the seeds for this trip 

were planted.   

<br/> <br/> 

The expedition leader is Inge Solheim of Norway who is on his 18th trip to the 

North Pole. Inge is an accomplished polar explorer who first skied to the pole in 

1999. In addition to guiding tours to both the North and South Pole, he has 

taken part in a number of documentaries for broadcasters that include the BBC, 

Channel 5 and NRK. Inge is a public speaker, philanthropist and brand 

ambassador for a number of global brands that include Helly Hansen.

Burak Öymen is an entrepreneur from Turkey who is on his first polar 

expedition.  In the past he has participated in a number of expeditions that 

include “flying” submersibles in the Mexican Pacific and driving across glaciers 

and volcanoes in Iceland.

With his life partner Tereza Maxova, the couple support philanthropic activities 

for a number of causes that range from AIDS awareness and research to helping 

orphans in various countries. They are actively engaged in trying to end 

whaling in the Caribbean island of Bequia and work with a group of fellow 

volunteers and the National Trust towards this goal.
